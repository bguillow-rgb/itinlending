# Changelog

**Append a dated entry here on every unit of work** (newest at top). This is part
of the documentation rule in the root `CLAUDE.md` — if a change isn't logged here
and reflected in the relevant doc, the task isn't done.

Format:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- What changed and why.
- Docs updated: <which project-docs file(s)>.
- Follow-ups / open items: <if any>.
```

## 2026-06-06 — Affiliate fallback chains + Path B parity + AdSense verified (all 3 sites)
- **Affiliate routing (#monetize):** added `AFFILIATE_FALLBACKS` to all 3
  `consts.ts` and rewrote `affiliateUrlFor()` to resolve own slug link → fallback
  chain → global apply URL → '' (callers route to `/apply`). So money pages with
  no dedicated program yet (ITIN mortgage/auto have none) route to a sensible
  sibling instead of a dead CTA.
- **Path B parity:** brought card + score `thank-you.astro` up to Itin's spec —
  lead form passes chosen product as `?for=<slug>`, thank-you page walks the
  fallback chain and reveals a matched affiliate CTA. Added `for=` slug mapping to
  card (`#card_type`) and score (`#goal`) LeadForms (Itin already had it).
- **Env docs:** annotated all 3 `.env.example` with which 2026-researched program
  goes in which `PUBLIC_AFFILIATE_URL_*` slot (Self/FlexOffers, OpenSky/credit.com,
  Credit Strong, Lendio, Sunwise; mortgage/auto = blank, fall back).
- **AdSense verified (no code change):** all 3 sites approval status "Getting
  ready", Auto ads/optimize OFF (correct), ad units live in built `/docs`,
  `ads.txt` reachable HTTP 200 with correct pub ID on all 3. AdSense "ads.txt not
  found" is crawl-timing only (sites added today) — no fix needed.
- Docs updated: MONETIZATION.md, this changelog.
- Follow-ups: user to finish Impact + FlexOffers (then CommissionSoup +
  credit.com) applications, then paste deep links into the env vars.

## 2026-06-06 — Per-page OG images, RSS feeds, branded favicons (all 3 sites)
- **Favicons (#fix):** all 3 sites previously shipped the same (wrong-brand)
  favicon. Rebuilt per-site `favicon.svg` "IN" monogram in each brand's colors,
  regenerated `favicon.png`/`icon-180.png`/`icon-512.png` via sharp, and added a
  multi-resolution `favicon.ico` (16/32/48) via ImageMagick. Added
  `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="any">` to `BaseLayout.astro`.
- **RSS (#12):** new hand-rolled RSS 2.0 endpoint `web/src/pages/rss.xml.js`
  (identical on all 3) emitting published articles newest-first; added
  `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">` to every page head.
- **OG per-page images (#9):** build-time generator `web/scripts/gen-og.mjs`
  (wired via `prebuild` npm script + `sharp` dep) renders a branded 1200×630 PNG
  per page/article into `public/og/<slug>.png` (homepage → `home.png`). Layouts
  (`BaseLayout`, `ArticleLayout`, `MoneyPageLayout`) + homepages pass a per-page
  `ogImage` so `og:image`/`twitter:image` resolve to the right card; falls back
  to `/og.png`. Verified: IL 10 / CC 9 / CS 10 OG PNGs; per-page og:image,
  favicon.ico, and rss alternate all present in built HTML.
- Docs updated: ARCHITECTURE.md (OG/RSS/favicon build steps), CHANGELOG.
- Follow-ups: content engine (#11) + programmatic state pages (#10) next;
  re-run IndexNow after publish.

## 2026-06-06 — Instrument event tracking on all 3 sites + analytics plan
- Audit finding: no analytics were live — GA4 wired but `PUBLIC_GA4_ID` unset on
  all 3 sites; zero custom events.
- Added centralized, delegated event tracking to `web/src/components/Analytics.astro`
  (identical file copied to all 3 repos): `window.itrack()` + events
  `lead_form_start`, `generate_lead`, `thank_you_view`, `affiliate_click`,
  `cta_click`. No-ops until GA4 is turned on; needs no edits to bespoke components.
- Added `project-docs/ANALYTICS-PLAN.md`: event table, KPIs, and the daily report
  architecture. Decisions: iMessage @ 6am local, 3 separate GA4 properties, GA4 +
  AdSense, GitHub Actions cron for the data pull + a local launchd job for the
  iMessage send (cloud CI cannot send iMessage).
- Affects: all 3 repos (Analytics.astro). Docs: ANALYTICS-PLAN.md (new), README.
- Follow-ups (blocked on user): 3 GA4 Measurement+Property IDs, GA4 Data API
  service account, AdSense OAuth refresh token, iMessage recipient. Then build
  `daily-report.mjs` + `daily-report.yml` + the launchd sender.

## 2026-06-06 — Document all three sites + cross-repo doc pointers
- Confirmed the family is THREE real, separate repos (not "planned"): ITIN Lending
  (`~/Itin`, itinlending.net), ITIN Credit Card (`~/ITINCreditCard`,
  itincreditcard.com), ITIN Credit Score (`~/ITINCreditScore`, itincreditscore.com).
- Added `project-docs/SITES.md` (per-site domains, repos, folders, money-page
  topology, shared-vs-per-site, the generator's vertical branching).
- Updated README, ROADMAP, and root CLAUDE.md to name all three sites concretely
  and point at SITES.md; `~/Itin/project-docs/` is the central docs hub for all 3.
- Added pointer `CLAUDE.md` to `~/ITINCreditCard` and `~/ITINCreditScore` so agents
  there load the documentation rule and find the hub.
- Docs updated: SITES.md (new), README.md, ROADMAP.md, root CLAUDE.md, two sibling
  CLAUDE.md.

## 2026-06-06 — Establish internal docs + documentation rule
- Created `project-docs/` (README, ARCHITECTURE, MONETIZATION, SEO-AEO,
  CONTENT-PIPELINE, OPERATIONS, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG) documenting everything built
  to date: the Astro/GitHub Pages stack, page types & layouts, EN/ES i18n,
  monetization (AdSense placement strategy, the lead form, CJ affiliate routing),
  SEO/AEO infrastructure, the automated daily content generator, and the three
  GitHub Actions workflows.
- Added root `CLAUDE.md` carrying the **documentation rule** (every agent updates
  the relevant doc + this changelog) and a hard warning that `/docs` is generated
  output (wiped on deploy — never hand-edit).
- Docs updated: all of `project-docs/`.
- Follow-ups: confirm site #2/#3 domains+verticals; parameterize hardcoded
  `itinlending.net` in monitor/indexnow/workflows before multi-site; fill GA4 +
  affiliate env vars.
